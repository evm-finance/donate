problems I faced:
My first attempt to track PnL was by reading raw swap events from the Uniswap v2 and v3 pools.
I realized that this was not a fully correct solution as it did not properly track swaps that crossed multiple pools,
so I began to rewrite a new solution that tracks transfers into and out of a user account, in transactions that contained a swap event

This does not use historical prices of tokens, simply tracks total amounts of tokens bought and sold using swap events
It also does not account for deposits/withdrawals into an account
It does not account for NFT transactions
